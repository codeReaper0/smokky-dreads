                    The SMOKKY community believes in uniqueness , as one of our emblems are expressing uniqueness in different ways. we believe the community should base the value of a SMOKKY DREAD'S on its art not rarity. However there are several rare unique attributes given to some NFTs among the SMOKKY DREAD'S collection. Each variant of SMOKKY DREAD'S comes with its own rarity.

                    Each SMOKKY DREAD'S NFT comes with its own unique identity. Owners of each SMOKKY DREAD'S owns the art IP. SMOKKY community allows the owners of each NFT to use the image as they wish with the exception of defamation/abusive purposes, so long as they own a SMOKKY DREAD'S NFT. Use of the image for profit must cease upon sales of the NFT. Although the holder owns the IP to their particular NFT, however they do not own any SMOKKY logos, sign's, identifiers etc. or other art that belong to the SMOKKY community and therefore cannot use it without written approval by the SMOKKY trustees.

                    dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
